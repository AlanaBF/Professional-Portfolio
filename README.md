# Professional-Portfolio
Alana's professional portfolio.

## Description

The page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

The my work section contains titled images of my applications

When presented with the my first application, the application's image is larger in size than the others

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
