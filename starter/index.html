      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Previously a secondary teacher of 20 years, currently upskilling to become a Front End Web Developer. Recently
        completed Prince2 Project Management Foundation, and in the process of completing Prince 2 Practitioner and
        Agile
        Foundation and Practitioner certificates and a 16 week Skills Bootcamp in Front End Web Development, using Zoom,
        Slack and Bootcamp Spot. I am excited to learn and develop further as a Front End Web Developer. I am
        passionate,
        creative, a team worker, and enjoy building projects from ideation to execution.
        As a teacher I have developed and progressed in a number of different directions including; boarding house
        parent,
        teacher of a number of different subjects, including; Animal Care, Physical Education, Geography, Maths,
        Religious
        Education (RE), a hockey and cricket coach, challenging myself to teach and live in Spain including as a
        Teaching
        English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) teacher.
        As well as this I have been a Probation Supervising Officer, renovated a house in Cornwall and started two big
        projects within my current role; starting and establishing a school farm and initiating and managing the Duke of
        Edinburgh Award. The most recent projects have been the most relevant to my decision to make a significant
        career
        change. Through these roles I have developed and honed my ability to push myself out of my comfort zone and
        developed a wide range of transferable soft skills. I am always looking for ways to further develop and improve.
        I
        have high expectations and promote a ‘can do’ mindset. As a patient person, I listen to others and offer a
        balanced opinion. I enjoy trying to bring the best out in everyone. I am punctual and always smartly turned out.
        I
        am highly motivated, have a good sense of humour and bags of energy. I have shown the ability to work well under
        direction as well as off my own initiative. I have good written and communication skills and excellent attention
        to detail. I am very friendly and approachable. Outside of my career, I love the great outdoors, my animals,
        sailing, water sports, camping, walking, gardening and travelling.
