          <h2>About Me</h2> 
    <p>Previously a secondary teacher of 20 years, currently upskilling to become a Front End Web Developer. Recently
      completed Prince2 Project Management Foundation, and in the process of completing Prince 2 Practitioner and Agile
      Foundation and Practitioner certificates and a 16 week Skills Bootcamp in Front End Web Development, using Zoom,
      Slack and Bootcamp Spot. I am excited to learn and develop further as a Front End Web Developer. I am passionate,
      creative, a team worker, and enjoy building projects from ideation to execution.
      As a teacher I have developed and progressed in a number of different directions including; boarding house parent,
      teacher of a number of different subjects, including; Animal Care, Physical Education, Geography, Maths, Religious
      Education (RE), a hockey and cricket coach, challenging myself to teach and live in Spain including as a Teaching
      English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) teacher.
      As well as this I have been a Probation Supervising Officer, renovated a house in Cornwall and started two big
      projects within my current role; starting and establishing a school farm and initiating and managing the Duke of
      Edinburgh Award. The most recent projects have been the most relevant to my decision to make a significant career
      change. Through these roles I have developed and honed my ability to push myself out of my comfort zone and
      developed a wide range of transferable soft skills. I am always looking for ways to further develop and improve. I
      have high expectations and promote a ‘can do’ mindset. As a patient person, I listen to others and offer a
      balanced opinion. I enjoy trying to bring the best out in everyone. I am punctual and always smartly turned out. I
      am highly motivated, have a good sense of humour and bags of energy. I have shown the ability to work well under
      direction as well as off my own initiative. I have good written and communication skills and excellent attention
      to detail. I am very friendly and approachable. Outside of my career, I love the great outdoors, my animals,
      sailing, water sports, camping, walking, gardening and travelling.
